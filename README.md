# Face-Recognition
Computer Vision
Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning. The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

Skills and Tools

Computer Vision, Keras, CNN, Siamese Networks, Triplet loss

Data Description:
Aligned Face Dataset from Pinterest
This dataset contains 10.770 images for 100 people. All images are taken from
'Pinterest' and aligned using dlib library

Project Description:
In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a face identification model to
recognize faces.
Data Description:
Aligned Face Dataset from Pinterest
This dataset contains 10.770 images for 100 people. All images are taken from
'Pinterest' and aligned using dlib library.
Objective:
In this problem, we use a pre-trained model trained on Face recognition to
recognize similar faces. Here, we are particularly interested in recognizing
whether two given faces are of the same person or not.
